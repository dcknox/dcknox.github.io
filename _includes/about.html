      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm a computational social scientist and an assistant professor
        in <a href="https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu">Operations, Information, and
        Decisions</a> at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. I
        study policing, ethnic politics, and political communication. I also
        develop quantitative models and methods for new forms of social science
        data. These new sources include many forms of data previously thought to
        be too unstructured to study: audiovisual data conveying human emotion,
        path data for sequential decision-making, and mobile location data on
        movement and social interaction. </p>
      <p>My research has appeared or is forthcoming in <i>Science</i>,
        the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>,
        the <i>Journal of the American Statistical Association</i>,
        <!-- the <i>Journal of Machine Learning Research</i>, -->
        and the <i>American Political Science Review</i>. It has been funded by the
        Carnegie Fellowship, the National Science Foundation, Microsoft, and
        Facebook; it received the Gosnell Prize for excellence in political
        methodology, the John T. Williams dissertation prize, and the best
        poster award by the Society for Political Methodology.</p>
      <p>Please
      visit <a href="https://www.policingresearch.org">policingresearch.org</a> for work
      by my group, Research on Policing Reform and Accountability, co-founded
      with Jonathan Mummolo. I am also a faculty fellow
      at <a href="https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/analytics/">Analytics at
      Wharton</a> and an affiliate of
      the <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/institutes/quattronecenter/">Quattrone
