- Thanks, xxx. Glad to be here.
- I'm going to be talking about the oversight and reform of police agencies
- and the challenges posed by police records, which are a problematic data source
- I'll show that we need to be very careful in analyzing this data, given all
  the things they **don't** see about police-civilian interactions
- and I'll provide some computational algorithms that can help us think through
  the implications of these data imperfections for the conclusions we can draw

# Police oversight: a review

???
- You probably don't need me to tell you why this is important
- But I do want to make two broad points to put things in context
- First
  - Police agencies are one of the most common public organizations around
  - I'd guess that almost everyone here has interacted with an officer at some point
- And second, police agencies suffer from a lack of perceived legitimacy
  - This isn't new, but it's worse than ever, at least in the 30 years Gallup's been tracking
  - and more specifically, two-thirds of Americans see police as discriminatory,
    trigger-happy, and unaccountable for their actions

--
- Among the most ubiquitous public organizations
  - Over 18k local law-enforcement agencies across US
  - Police contact >20% of Americans each year .tiny[(BJS, '22)]

--
- Confidence in police at a historic low: 43% .tiny[(Gallup, '23)]
  
--
  - Treating racial and ethnic groups equally: 65% negative .tiny[(Pew, '20)]
  - Using the right amount of force: 64% negative .tiny[(Pew, '20)]

--
- Police misconduct remains disturbingly frequent

???
- And this isn't just an LAPD issue
- In the last few years alone, we've seen the killing of Breonna Taylor, the murders of George Floyd and Tyre Nichols, and too many others

# Police oversight: a review

- Among the most ubiquitous public organizations
  - Over 18k local law-enforcement agencies across US
  - Police contact >20% of Americans each year .tiny[(BJS, '22)]
- Confidence in police at a historic low: 43% .tiny[(Gallup, '23)]

  - Breonna Taylor killing, George Floyd & Tyre Nichols murders

???
- I should say that these aren't just sensationalist examples
- these are all cases where, as part of the DOJ investigation team,
  we're implementing exactly the concepts that I'll describe
- Now, police agencies have strong incentives to address these issues themselves
  - It's well known that when people see the police as legitimate
  - They're more willing to report crimes and provide evidence
- But for a variety of reasons, historically, reform just hasn't come from within
  - these include the strength of unions and the "thin blue line" culture
- instead, reform tends to come from external sources, especially lawsuits and
  federal investigations
  - and that means it's crucial to statistically estimate misconduct and
    understand where it's coming from
  - because you can't reform what you can't see

--
- Undermines org. performance .tiny[(Obama Task Force on Policing, '15)]
  - Public trust & legitimacy &rightarrow; obey law, help investigations

--
- Cultural & institutional barriers to internal reform
  - Reform comes from courts, fed. investigations, legislation

--
  - This means quantifying misconduct is prerequisite to reform

# The central challenge

- Classic principal-agent problem:
  - Democratically elected principals seek to uphold civil rights
  - Agents seek to preserve discretion, resist civilian oversight

???
- At this point, you're probably thinking this sounds like a classic
  principal-agent problem, and you'd be right
  - The general public, through democratically elected leaders,
    delegate the power to legally use force to police agents so they can enforce
    the law
  - And the goal of civilian oversight is to ensure that agents do that while
    upholding civil rights
- This is one of the hardest principal-agent problems imaginable
  - and even apart from the public-policy issues, these least-likely case are
    worth studying
  - because there are all kinds of interesting challenges, and resolving them
    leads to some very interesting new theory
- Here's the central problem:
  - Almost all the data that we use for oversight is self-reported, through
    organizational processes designed by police, for police purposes
- and the core point I want to make, the one thing I hope you take away from
  this talk
- Is that for this reason, we can't simply apply off-the-shelf methods designed
  for as-if-randomly sampled, gold-standard data
  - I'll show you that when we do that, we draw unsupportable conclusions
  - and instead, we have to account for the processes that filter and distort
    what we get to see

--
- Monitoring relies heavily on agent self-reporting
  - Data has inaccuracies, selective reporting, omitted variables

# Overview

1. Fundamental limits of policing data & analyses
  - What we can & cannot see about agent behavior
  - Desire for "the answer" &rightarrow; unsupported conclusions

???
- In the rest of this talk, I'm first going to clarify exactly what I mean when
  I say "police data is incomplete"
  - I'll show that it just doesn't make sense to think about "the answer" to a
    question like "how much do police discriminate?" given those
    challenges. there are many possible answers, all of which are consistent
    with the available information
- that's going to bring us to the focus of today's talk, which is the following
  very general question: suppose you have some social process you want to study,
  and some incomplete data about it. what's the **range** of possible answers?
  - this is going to have the flavor of formal logic: here are the theoretical
    premises, here is the data we've been able to collect. I'll argue that we,
    as scientists, should be spending our time here
  - but then, given that, we should ask: what are the scientific conclusions
    that follow? and I'll argue that computers should handle this tedious
    deduction
- I'll show how this can help us reason about police oversight by asking, what's
  the best case? is it possible that officers are enforcing the law in a
  race-neutral manner? if not, what's the worse case? how bad could it be?
- and I'll show that we can think about how to design work so that we limit the
  worst-case harm that agents can cause
- finally, I'll show you how similar challenges arise all the time in social
  science, with examples from another famous discrimination case (Walmart v
  Dukes), with examples of descriptive research (drawing on some of my own work
  using computational proxies, like estimates of vocal tone and facial
  expressions, to study conversation). 


--
1. Algorithm-assisted deduction from theory & evidence
  - Given explicit theoretical premises & incomplete data,<br>

--
    what is the range of conclusions that can be drawn?
--
  - Quantifying best-case racial discrimination in policing

--
  - Org. design to limit worst-case harm from agent discretion

--
1. Broad applicability to other settings that require careful reasoning from
   theory & incomplete data

--
  - Other discrimination litigation, e.g. *Wal-Mart v. Dukes*

--
  - Descriptive research, e.g. conversation analysis w/ proxies

--
  - Causal research under selection, missingness, confounding...

# Data limitations
# in police oversight

???
- so, let's dive right in
- I'll start by showing you what the data looks like
---

<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_01.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- one of the most important tasks in oversight is assessing racial bias in use of force
- here, our unit of analysis is the police-civilian encounter
- in this diagram, that means estimating whether force (the outcome) is used at
  different rates if, hypothetically, we could swap out a minority civilian for
  a white civilian in every encounter

---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_02.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- for this to be a useful exercise, we'll need to account for civilian behavior (for the sake of argument, let's say we swap in a white actor who is behaving the same way)
---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_03.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- we'll also need to consider context like the time of day, perhaps the officer's assigned job (like traffic enforcement or bike patrol)
- and after accounting for all this, we'll ask whether there's discriminatory violence
---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_04.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- it's important to note that officers rarely jump directly to force
- what usually happens is they detain a civilian, perhaps interrogate them,
  before escalating to violence
---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_05.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- and during the course of that stop, other events can be informative
- for example, if officers are looking for weapons, we can ask: how often were
  they found? if that differs by race, it can indicate there's discrimination in
  who officers are stopping
---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_06.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- OK, so one of the questions we'll look at today is diversity reforms in hiring
- this is a big proposal from the literature on bureaucracies (descriptive
  representation, to hire officers that look like they people they serve)
- and the question is whether those officers actually do their jobs differently,
  or if "blue is blue" and it doesn't matter
---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_07.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- the thing is, there are all kinds of other factors that influence an officer's decisions
- someone who's more suspicious, or even just feeling cranky that day, they may
  be more willing to initiate a stop and use force
---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_08.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- but that kind of information on an officer's mental state will never appear in
  administrative records
---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_09.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- and that's not the only problem
- in most cases, we don't get to see the actual behavior of the civilian
---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_10.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- we only get the description reported by the officer
---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_11.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- and what's more, we only see any of this if a stop is made, and officers fill out the stop form
---
<img src="./resources/images/intro_dag_12.png" style="position: absolute; left: 2.5%; top: 20%; width: 100%; z-index: ;"/>
???
- if they choose not to initiate that stop, then the encounter just vanishes
  without a trace in the data

- first, in terms of fatal shootings, police are "if anything" biased against
  white people
- which may be surprising, if you follow American history
- but for a certain set, this was an extremely popular finding

- the second claim was that diversifying police forces won't work

# How was the data analyzed?

???
- these are big claims that we'd hope are based on strong reasoning
  - because this stuff really matters
  - you may recall a headline from 2020, when a high-ranking major in the Tulsa
    PD reviewed the literature and said in an interview "all of their research
    says we're shooting African Americans... less than we probably ought to be"
  - He was referring to this paper and another one, by Roland Fryer, that I'll
    discuss in a second
- here's what I would've liked to see
  - define the monitoring question: when black and white civilians behave in the
    same way, are officers more likely to shoot one group than another?

- this paper is interesting because it doesn't do that
- instead, it exemplifies the standard approach to research in this domain
- which is, find some data that's easy to collect
- pick some model that's easy to use
  - plug the data into the model, get an some stars in your regression, and spin
    a story about police reform
- what this gives you is ONE possible answer to the question that the model is
  asking (which often differs from the question the researcher had in mind),
  under the implicit assumption that you have gold-standard, randomly sampled
  data (assumptions that would be untenable if we actually had to say them out
  loud and really grapple with them)
- I should say that this contrast between abduction & deduction is something
  that comes from Jesper, actually, in the context of the Walmart v Dukes case
  that I'll return to shortly
- what we proved the data and design in this study were fundamentally
  uninformative about the claims that were made
  - if you think critically about this system, there's so much that we can't see
  - the agent could be anti-white, race-neutral, anti-minority
  - anything could be possible: in other words, there's nothing to back up those
    claims

  - Assemble data that is reasonably convenient to collect

  - Pick an off-the-shelf statistical/ML/AI model to analyze it

--
  - Informally discuss some implications for policing reform

- next, we'll break down police-civilian encounters into four ideal types
  - there's a kind of scenario, like a violent crime in progress, where officers
    basically have no discretion. the civilian's race doesn't matter, officers
    have to make the stop
  - there's another scenario with no discretion, like if someone walks up and
    asks for directions. again, race doesn't matter: no officer would initiate a
    formal stop.
  - but now let's think about potential sources of discretion. we have good
    reason to suspect that minority civilians may be stopped in innocuous
    situations where white civilians would pass unremarked, like for jaywalking.
  - and conversely, in theory, there could be scenarios where officers make
    discriminatory stops of white people, but it's hard to imagine what those
    might be

- and this is what you get
- on the left we have Fryer's original estimate, which says about 6% of
  encounters involved discriminatory force, or about 200,000 over a decade of
  NYPD stop-and-frisks
- and what we show is that the only way that could possibly be true is if there
  is zero discrimination in who officers choose to stop
  - in other words, we show that this extremely common form of analysis
    implicitly assumes that there are absolutely no jaywalking-type encounters
  - but it is a bit odd to assume away discrimination in stopping, in a study
    that is trying to estimate how police officers discriminate in use of force
- and depending on how bad that initial stop discrimination is (which we can't
  directly see in this data), the range of possibilities could be much, much worse
- here's that same result with confidence intervals
- it turns out that other studies have looked at stop discrimination in other
  ways, like that "hit rate" analysis I mentioned earlier, and they consistently
  find that at least one third of minority stops are discriminatory
- which implies we're over here: there were at least 400,000 discriminatory uses
  of force, and it could be much worse

- that was for officers laying hands on a civilian, but we can repeat this
  exercise for other levels of force, like putting someone on the ground or
  striking them with a baton
- and across the board, the takeaway is the same
- in many cases, the standard approach would seem to show no discrimination
- but that's because it's naively taking the police data at face value, rather
  than thinking about blind spots in agent self-reports
- when you actually account for the fact that the minority data is diluted by a
  huge number of jaywalking-type encounters, you immediately see that the true
  severity of the problem is far larger than it originally appeared
- now, I've worked quite closely with the ACLU legal analytics team, and they
  tell me that the methods we developed in this paper are now standard practice
  in their discrimination cases

# Minimax org. design

- **Goal:** constrain worst-case agent deviation

--
  - Bounds show obs. indistinguishable agent behavior
  - Highest point of this region represents the worst case

--
- Shape of a squad's bounds are governed by:
  - **Width:** amount of discretion to initiate stops
  - **Slope:** total amount of force used by the squad
  - **Intercept:** racial diff. in use-of-force rates, ignoring whether stop
    should have been made in the first place
--
- Reforms can be designed to constrain these factors, but the set of feasible
  reforms depends on context

???
- as a concrete example, think about two kinds of units: plainclothes and
  uniformed squads
- in NYPD, plainclothes officers use slightly more force, so the red slope is
  a little bit higher
- and plainclothes officers have greater observed disparities, so the intercept
  is higher
- how can we redesign their work to reduce the blue and red peaks?
- for uniformed officers, we can limit discretion in stopping: tighten the rules
  of engagement, so this blue region doesn't extend as far to the right
- but that reform doesn't make sense for plainclothes officers: the whole point
  of those squads is blend in, they have to adapt to the situation and exercise
  discretion
- so what else can we do? well, we can target the slope: limit the amount of
  force they use. plainclothes officers are best for surveillance and informant
  work, they shouldn't need to use force
  - we can enforce that with a policy that says, if you do use force, you're put
    on desk duty for a week while internal affairs investigates
  - do it too many times, and you're put back on uniformed patrol

---

<img src="resources/images/klm_tasks.png" style="position: absolute; top: 0%; left: 0%; width: 100%"/>

???
- we can use the same ideas to reason about task allocation
- let's talk about
  - low-discretion stops like violent crime
  - high-discretion stops like "furtive movement"
  - and everything else in the middle
- so this is kind of the reverse situation:
  - the nature of dealing with violent crime is you often need to use force
  - we can't intervene on that, so the next best option is to take that task and
    give it to dedicated SWAT-type units who just respond to calls
  - don't let heavily armed officers just roam the streets with discretion to
    stop whoever they want
- we could imagine a different reform for these really questionable stops like
  "furtive movement" and "suspicious bulge": increase accountability to peers
  and leaders by hiring more minority officers
  - that's a reform that we can conceptualize as reducing the intercept, the
    slope, AND the horizontal width

# How can we extend this
# approach to other agencies
# and data environments?

???
- what we've talked about so far are two specific monitoring tasks
  - when you have data on officer-involved shootings or stops, respectively
- but there are 18,000 law enforcement agencies in america
  - each of them potentially recording different combinations of data
  - and if we have to sit down to derive bounds on terms of agent behavior for
    each one, that's just not feasible
- so now I'm going to talk about how we built an algorithm to automate this
  best-/worst-case reasoning

  embedded in the road that tell us how many cars go by
  - so we don't just know that 250 stops were made
  - we also know that there were 1000 vehicles in total, so 25% were stopped
- they record how fast the car is going, too

- now we can geometrically represent the possible states of the world
- each point in this cube is one possible world
  - or one way that drivers are behaving and agents are reacting
- the height of that point is the proportion of minority drivers

???
- now we can start pulling in the traffic-sensor data
- we know that 25% of cars are stopped, which narrows down the possibilities
- we can backward induct: how does a stop occur?
  - it could be that a minority driver met an anti-minority officer
  - or, it could be that they met an always-stop officer
  - or a white person met that always-stop officer
- what this is saying is that, even though we can't directly see what's going on
  out there on the highway, we can indirectly reason about it
  - the unobserved reality has to be somewhere on this surface
- the fact that only 25% of cars are stopped helps rule out a lot of options
  - like, obviously it can't be that there 100% always-stops, because that
    wouldn't add up

- and we can do the same with our police stop records
- we know that 75% of stopped cars had minority drivers
- again, backward inducting: what does that tell us about the possible states of
  the world?
- it says the unobserved world has to be somewhere on **this** surface, too
- for example it can't be that every driver is white, because that would
  contradict the fact that we have all these minority stops

  possibilities
- and after triangulating all of this information, we can ask:
  - given what we know, and what we've been able to rule out
  - among all the possible worlds that remain
- what's the best-case scenario for agent behavior? 
  - is it possible that they're not discriminating?
  - or can we rule race-neutral behavior with this incomplete information?

- and we can bring in even more information
- we have mobile-phone data that says, when you look at gas stations along the
  highway
- say, 40% of customers are minorities
  - of course that doesn't mean that exactly 40% of police encounters are with
    minorities
  - but it's unlikely that police are seeing less than 20% minorities, or more
    than 60%
  - in other words, the unobserved world has to be somewhere in this range

# Reasoning from 
# incomplete data is
# ubiquitous in social science

???
- of course, researchers have grappled with incomplete or imperfect data in many
  areas beyond police discrimination
  - The first use of bounds that I've been able to find is by Gini, who most
    people probably know from the Gini coefficient
  - he used bounds in the context of measurement error, which is a really
    ubiquitous issue
- I'll talk through three kinds of research where they occur
- first, I'll show how similar challenges arise in other legal disputes over
  discrimination
- it's worth noting that discrimination claims are just a special case of causal
  claims more broadly: that a minority individual would have been treated
  differently, counterfactually, from a similarly situated white individual
- so, second, I'll talk about how researchers have dealt with related issues in
  causal inference
- and finally, I'll show that you still need to worry this stuff even if you
  don't do causal work
- we often want to make descriptive claims about social processes that we lack
  complete data on, and we encounter the same issues there

# Discrimination litigation

- Social-science research in *Wal-Mart v. Dukes*

???
- I'll start off by recapping a prominent debate over another discrimination
  case, against Walmart, where you'll see a lot of the same issues appear
- social science research appeared in a few ways
- a statistician, Richard Droghin, testified about disparate *outcomes*
  for women: they were overrepresented in hourly jobs, but underrepresented in
  management
- then a sociologist, William Bielby, testified that Walmart had policies that,
  *in other settings*, had been shown to disadvantage women
  - these are things like discretion in promotions, requiring managers to move
    for promotion, etc.
  - so far, these are just some incomplete facts
- the issue was that Bielby then made a causal claim that Walmart itself engaged
  in discrimination
- even though he could not trace a direct connection between the policies and
  the disparate outcomes in Walmart specifically
- Note to self: "Discretionary and subjective elements of Wal-Mart's personnel
  system and inadequate oversight and ineffective anti-discrimination efforts
  contribute to disparities between men and women in their compensation and
  career trajectories at the company" (Bielby '03)
  
--
- Descriptive stats. on Wal-Mart employees .tiny[(Drogin, '03)]
  - Shows that there are disparate <u>outcomes</u> by gender
  - E.g. women hold 2&frasl;3 of hourly jobs, 1&frasl;3 of mgmt. jobs

--
- Wal-Mart has certain policies/practices .tiny[(Bielby, '03)] 
  - E.g. managers have discretion in compensation & promotion
  - Past work shows these cause discrimination in *other* cases

--
- Ergo, Wal-Mart engages in disparate <u>treatment</u> .tiny[(Bielby, '03)]

**Critiques:**
- One critique, by Chris Winship, was that this is just unscientific
  - And the argument was very similar to the policing case
  - We need to think about what he called the "data biases," in other words, how
    the things we can see might differ systematically from the things we can't
    see
- Yesper Soerensen and Amanda Sharkey said, well wait, it is scientific 
  - in the sense that abductive reasoning (or theory generation) is part of the
    scientific process.
  - but abduction is just the start; it establishes *one* possible explanation,
    it doesn't show that it's the *only* explanation
  - to finish the job, we need hypothetico-deductive reasoning, which this is not
- and finally, some legal scholars argued that if we're going to use sociology
  in court, then it needs to be based on hypothetico-deductive reasoning
  - we can't just present the best-case explanation. normatively, we have a
    responsibility to honestly disclose all the possible explanations (claims
    that are consistent with the evidence)

**That's a lot of work.** But a nice shortcut, which I'll return to shortly, is
to just think about the best- and worst-case explanations from the perspective
of the claim you'd like to make. The ones in between don't really matter.

# Debate over Bielby ('03)

- **Critiques:**
  - Science must consider data biases, alt. hypotheses .tiny[(Winship, '11)]
  - Abductive, not hypothetico-deductive .tiny[(Sørensen & Sharkey, '11)]<br>
  .gray["proposed explanation may be consistent with an observed set of facts,
    [but] other explanations cannot be ruled out"]
  - Expert testimony should candidly assess inferences that may be drawn in light of data and method constraints .tiny[(Mitchell et al. '11)]
- **A practical solution:** best- and worst-case reasoning
- **Counterargument:**
  - Law is adversarial, unlike science .tiny[(Tomaskovic-Devey, '11)]
  .gray["If the defense has a plausible alternative explanation for disparities,
  I see it as their job to provide it"]

???
**Counterarguments:**
- On the other hand, some folks said, whoa, whoa.
  - It's not my job to do the other side's work for them
  - Maybe in science we need to think about alternative explanations, but law is
    different. If I'm testifying in support of a discrimination claim, all I
    need to do is present the best-case scenario
- And others went even further, to say no, actually, even in science (and
  sociology specifically) it's totally ok to just present the best-case scenario
  and ignore alternative explanations, people do it all the time

- but this applies much more broadly than just discrimination
- in my own work, I do a lot of descriptive analysis of speech style, with audio
  and video recordings
- you can imagine asking, do groups that engage in deliberation communicate
  differently from those who do other tasks?
- is there a correlation between the rules of the meeting, like unanimous
  decision versus majority rule, and the way people communicate?

- how does group diversity relate to communication style?
- obviously, when we're working with observational data, these aren't causal
  questions
- though they may suggest causal questions to explore later
- individuals can choose to opt out of different kinds of groups, say by
  quitting their job
- and often in this research, we're not worried about that

- but here's the thing
- it's rare that we can really, truly measure something like vocal tone or
  facial expressions
- sure, you could imagine an observer sitting there and hand-coding these things
- but that's expensive, and so increasingly, we only do that for a small sample
  of observations
- then, often, we train a machine-learning algorithm to do that task cheaply for
  the rest of the dataset

- but if all we have is this machine-learning proxy of communication style
- say the original question is whether there's more conflict in diverse groups
- and our machine-learning algorithm is mostly just picking up on how loud the
  audio is
- does that really let us answer the question we originally cared about?
- sure, we could change the question and say, "oh, I only want to know how
  diverse or homogeneous groups vary on this proxy, loudness"
- but then we're just doing the same thing that the causal folks are accused of:
  answering the less-interesting easy question
- if we're being honest, loudness isn't intrinsically interesting. what if the
  group gets in a big fight and half the team leaves the room? then it's quiet,
  but that doesn't mean it's nonconflictual

- and it can get much worse
- for example, we know that vocal tone is measured with greater error for people
  with accents
- and diverse teams are more likely to have people who speak in different accents
- which means the measurement error is contaminated by one of the quantities of
  interest
- and if that's going on, we need to be very careful about which descriptive
  claims can and can't be supported
- we don't want to say that diverse teams have a different style of
  communication, if that's really just a spurious finding driven by a deficiency
  in the way we measure communication style

# Causal research

- Concerns about incomplete or imperfect data are widespread in research aiming
  to make causal claims
  - Confounding, noncompliance, selection, missingness

???
- as I mentioned earlier, a discrimination claim is one particular kind of
  causal claim
- and if we look out at the causal inference literature more broadly, there's
  more recognition of the problems that incomplete data can pose
- people are quite worried about confounding, selection, missingness, and so on
- but in practice, the way that people researchers address these issues is very
  different from the kind of deductive reasoning that was proposed in Walmart v
  Dukes
- what we often see is researchers making assumptions that would justify the
  claim they want to make. Can't have unobserved confounding? OK, then let's
  just assume that the controls I have are sufficient.
- or we see people changing the question to something easier to answer
  - say we want to know how much incarceration hurts your future job prospects,
    but obviously incarceration isn't random
  - so let's change the question: how much does getting assigned to a strict
    judge versus a lenient judge affect job prospects, AMONG the subset of
    defendents where the judge has discretion?
  - that's all well and good, but let's be honest: it wasn't what we originally
    wanted to know
- perhaps the most principled response is to say, look, if I can't do this study
  well, then I'm not going to do it at all
- but that has its own problems: it's what critics of the so-called "causal
  revolution" call a narrowing of science to focus on easier questions
- what I'll show in a moment is a way that we can honestly acknowledge the
  complexities of real-world research, ask the questions that we really want to
  ask, and let the chips fall where they may in terms of best- and worst-case
  answers

--
- **Typical responses:**
  1. <u>Ignore the issue</u> assume the complications away

--
  1. <u>Change the question</u>: focus on a narrower, easier problem

--
  1. <u>Terminate the study</u>: work on something else instead

--
- Widespread concern that "causal revolution" has led researchers to gloss over
  real-world intricacies, <br>focus more narrowly on easier-to-answer problems

- **A practical solution:** best- and worst-case reasoning

# Other ongoing work

???
- alright, so before we wrap up, I'll take just a few minutes to introduce a few
  projects that I'm pretty excited about

---

# Other ongoing work

???
1. having now worked on a number of doj investigations, something that stands
   out is the amount of qualitative review that lawyers do
  - in terms of case review, watching bodycam video, and so on
  - there's just no replacement for getting your hands dirty in the raw data
  - what we realized was that there were huge inefficiencies in the process
  - and that we could use an extension the quantitative analysis I just
    presented to help with case selection for the qualitative analysis
  - to efficiently target cases that can narrow down (in that investigation)
    possible agent behavior toward mentally ill people
  <!-- - if you're worried about officers misrepresenting civilian behavior,
  then we --> <!-- should be specifically hunting down those "resisting arrest"
  and "suspicious --> <!-- behavior" cases and studying those -->
1. the second project looks at bodycam video from a different angle
   - these videos are interesting because they're such a waste of
     resources. agencies pay insane amounts of money to store terabytes of
     footage, but police chiefs tell us hardly anyone watches it because
     it's too much work
   - we're using computer-vision and speech-analysis to summarize videos so a
     sergeant can get an automatic weekly update that they can skim

--
1. Efficient allocation of monitoring resources
  - Verifying agent-reported data with bodycam review is costly

--
  - Techniques for efficiently allocating principal's data-collection
    resources (identify videos that help narrow bounds fastest)
--
1. Computational methods for early intervention
  - Computer-vision & speech analysis of bodycam videos

--
1. Descriptive representation in police bureaucracies
  - Largest public registry of officers, 99 of top 100 agencies

???
- a third project is looking at this idea of descriptive representation
  - that you can get better performance from a bureaucracy by staffing it with
    people who are like the customers and can understand them
  - we've collected what's now the largest registry of officers nationwide,
    covering more than a third of local law enforcement and 99 of the 100 largest
    agencies
  - we quantify how much local police diverge from local residents on race,
    gender, age, income, political orientation
  - and show why that matters in terms of enforcement decisions
- and a fourth project I mentioned briefly at the start
  - looking at how civilian oversight is structured nationwide
  - getting incredibly detailed process data on how misconduct is investigated
    and how officers almost never get serious discipline for it
  - we find showing this data to local residents makes them trust police less
    and want to cooperate less
  - but you can counteract that somewhat with greater transparency
  - walking residents through the process in detail (here's what officers are
    accused of, here's what was done to investigate, here's the evidence, etc)

--
1. Management of police misconduct investigations
  - National census of oversight organizations

--
  - Process data on findings & discipline (Chicago, NYC, Phila.)

--
  - Weak transparency undermines civilian trust & willingness<br> to cooperate, but strong transparency improves it

- how would you tackle this in earnest?
  - i'll come back to claim #1 (racial bias) in a second
  - and for now focus on claim #2 (diversifying police)
- it took my team three years of foia requests to get enough data to do a
  careful, causally identified analysis of police diversification
- who officers were, what actions they took, when and where they showed up to
  work every day
- those shift records are key, because they let us see when different kinds
  officers get assigned to do the same tasks and face the same kinds of
  civilian behavior
  - that lets us ask, why is it one officer can do their job without resorting
    to violence, while another seems to use force a lot?
- what we found was that actually, having a diverse police force matters a lot
  - officers who are minority or female tend to engage in less enforcement
  - but it's not that they're just pulling back: there's almost no difference in
    how they handle violent crime
  - instead, it's that these officers make fewer minor drug arrests, and
    stopping people for questionable things like "loitering" or "suspicious
    behavior" less
  - and it turns out that means fewer black residents get caught up in this
    low-level discretionary enforcement

--
- Data covering ~7,000 officers; 
--
~1.6 million stops, arrests, uses of force; 
--
~2.9 million shift assignments

--
- Use of shift records is crucial:
  - Identifies officers assigned to face common circumstances
  - Accounts for days when officers choose to take no action

--
- When facing the same pool of civ. behavior:
  - Minority & female officers enforce less severely
  - Effects largest for minority civs. and minor offenses
